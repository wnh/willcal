# WillCal

A calendar application built with NW.js, React, and TypeScript. Uses SQLite for local persistence and Redux for state management. Features drag-and-drop scheduling with week/month/agenda views.

## Notes for Claude

- Every time we add a new feature that is in the UI, you should add a block to `Testing.md` with manual testing steps for me to follow
- Always run `npm run build` after making code changes
